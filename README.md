# Movie Recommendation System

This Python script implements a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering. The system suggests movies similar to a user's input based on the movie's genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- difflib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Upload your Data Set:**
   - Place your movie dataset file (`movies.csv`) in the same directory as the script.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script in a Python environment.

```python
python movie_recommendation.py
```

3. **Enter Your Favorite Movie:**
   - Input the name of your favorite movie when prompted.

4. **View Recommended Movies:**
   - The system will suggest a list of movies similar to your input based on content features.

## Code Explanation

- The script reads the movie dataset (`movies.csv`) using pandas and selects relevant columns.

- Null values in selected features (genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director) are replaced with empty strings.

- Feature vectors are created by combining the selected features and converting them into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.

- Cosine similarity is calculated between the feature vectors of movies to determine their similarity.

- Users are prompted to input their favorite movie, and a close match is found using the `difflib` library.

- Similarity scores between the input movie and all others are obtained, and movies are sorted based on these scores.

- The top 30 recommended movies are printed to the console.

## Note

- Ensure that your dataset (`movies.csv`) is appropriately formatted with columns such as 'title,' 'genres,' 'keywords,' 'tagline,' 'cast,' and 'director.'

- Adjust the script or dataset if necessary to fit the specific format of your data.
